## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Setup & Build Guide

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed:

- Git
- Docker
- Java JDK 21
- Gradle (or use `./gradlew` wrapper)
- **Note that this is the main setup for the backend. In order to setup the frontend, please consult the following [README.md](https://github.com/SOEN490-SportsApp/SportsApp/tree/chore/issue-137/read-me-setup-for-project/ClientApp#readme
) to understand more about the Expo app.**

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

---

### 2. Build the Application with Gradle

Use the Gradle wrapper to build the project:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

This command compiles, packages, and runs all unit tests.

---

### 3. Docker Containerization

#### üîπ Build the JAR

```bash
./gradlew build
```

The generated JAR file will be located in `build/libs/` as `project-name-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

#### üîπ Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build --build-arg JAR_FILE=build/libs/project-name-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar -t project-image .
```

#### üîπ Run Docker Container

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env project-image
```

> Replace `.env` with the path to your environment variable file, or set the variables directly in the command line.

#### Gradle Build and Dependency Configuration
The `build.gradle` file specifies dependencies, configurations, and build tasks. Key sections include:

---

### 4. Docker Compose Setup for Microservices
This project relies on several microservices, each with its own Docker setup. All microservices depend on the services defined in a shared `docker-compose.yml` file, which includes services such as MongoDB, MySQL (for Keycloak), and Keycloak itself. These services must be running for the microservices to function properly.
The `docker-compose.yml` file configures and manages the required services. You will need to ensure that the services are up and running before starting any microservice.

We use a **monorepo architecture** with services located in `Microservices/<service-name>`.

Here are the required backend services:

| Microservice           | Docker Package                     |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Event Service          | `sportsapp-event-service`          |
| User Service           | `sportsapp-user-service`           |
| Messaging Service      | `sportsapp-messaging-service`      |
| Storage Service        | `sportsapp-storage-service`        |
| API Gateway            | `sportsapp-gateway`                |
| Kafka Event Model      | `app.sportahub.kafka-events`       |
| Orchestration Service  | `sportsapp-orchestration-service`  |
| Email Service          | `sportsapp-email-service`          |
| Notification Service   | `sportsapp-notification-service`   |

---
#### How to Set it Up:
1. Navigate to the directory of the microservice you want to run.

2. Make sure the `docker-compose.yml` file is present and configured.

3. Run the following command to start all the required services for that microservice:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
Once the services are up and running, the microservice will be able to interact with MongoDB, Keycloak, and other dependencies.

---

### 5. Running Multiple Microservices
The project consists of several microservices, each located in its respective folder under `Microservices/<service-name>`. The README assumes the backend is located at the root of the project directory, but since we have multiple microservices, each microservice has its own folder and configuration.

To run a specific microservice, you need to follow the setup steps (including using Docker Compose) inside each microservice directory:
1. Navigate to the corresponding microservice directory under `Microservices/`:
```bash
cd Microservices/<service-name>
```

2. Run Docker Compose for that microservice:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This ensures that each microservice runs with its own set of services (like databases or authentication), and you can independently manage and deploy them as needed.

#### Running the Application
After building the project and Docker image, you can access the application at `http://localhost:8080`
