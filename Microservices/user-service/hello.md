hey @frontend, 

as you may know, we should become stricter with respect to our code coverage. The goal is to reach 80% coverage. To get the most meaningful coverage possible for the ClientApp, we need to decide what coverage criteria to follow. 
Here are the criteria and why one may/not choose one or the other:

- Functional coverage: Ensures that the functions in your code behave as expected. It's good for verifying that your components are working properly at a high level.
- Branch coverage: Tests that every possible branch of a control structure (like if/else statements) is executed. This is particularly useful for covering conditional logic and ensuring that all decision points are tested.
- Line coverage: This measures how many lines of your code are executed during tests. While useful, it's not always the best indicator of test quality since it doesnâ€™t guarantee that your logic is actually tested.

We can aim for 80% on functional and 60% on branch. Let me know what y'all think.
